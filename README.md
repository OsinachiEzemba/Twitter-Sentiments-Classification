# Twitter-Sentiments-Classification
Using Natural Language Processing to classify an individual's belief in climate change based on their tweets.

# Context:
In the face of increasing skepticism towards climate change, companies positioning themselves as environmentally conscious or offering eco-friendly products face challenges without robust market research. To complement ongoing efforts, a Machine Learning model is needed to classify individuals' belief in climate change based on their unique tweet data.

# Expected Outcomes:

- Identify patterns and trends within tweet data.
- Develop a model capable of classifying sentiment towards climate change.
- Construct a user-friendly app for seamless model utilization.
- Present key findings to stakeholders for informed decision-making.

# Tools Utilized:
- Python
- Streamlit
- scikit-learn
- nltk
- Comet
- GitHub
- AWS EC2

# Output:
A comprehensive demonstration of the app, showcasing the developed sentiment classification model and its application to analyze climate change beliefs based on tweet data.
